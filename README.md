## What is Kubernetes?
- Kubernetes, often abbreviated as “K8s”, orchestrates containerized applications to run on a cluster of hosts. 
- Kubernetes is an open-source platform which automates the deployment and management of cloud native applications using on-premises infrastructure or public cloud platforms. 
- Kubernetes automates the vital aspects of container lifecycle management, including scaling, replication, monitoring, and scheduling.
- Some Extra points:
   - CNCF Graduated.
   - Born Outof Borg and Omega.
   - Launched in 2014. 
   - Designed for Scale.
   - Run anywhere. 

## Why Kubernetes?
 - Few containersa are fine but what about if we have millions of them?
 - How to monitor them?
 - What about solving the problem of overloading a single node? What about running the containers on Various nodes?
 - Autoscaling if we just need to spill out or spill in desired containers. That too automatically.
 - Scheduling. 
 - Self Healing Capabilities.
